The effect we are interested in is **causal** because we want to know how $Y$ changes if all randomness other than $Z$ remains fixed, and only $Z$ changes. We will refer to $Z$ as the \"treatment\". In general, $Z$ might be multi-dimensional, however for the purpose of this exercise we take $Z \\in\\mathbb{R}$.\n",
